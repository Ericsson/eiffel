# EiffelArtifactReusedEvent (ArtR)
The EiffelArtifactReusedEvent declares that an identified [EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent](./EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent.md) has been _reused_ for an identified [EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent](./EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent.md). This means that it is logically equivalent to an artifact that would have been built from that composition, and can be used for build avoidance (see the [Build Avoidance Usage Example](../usage-examples/build-avoidance.md) for more information).

The event has no data members, but solely relies on its two required link types __REUSED_ARTIFACT__ and __COMPOSITION__ (see below).

## Data Members

## Links
### COMPOSITION
__Required:__ Yes  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the composition for which an already existing artifact (identified by __REUSED_ARTIFACT__) is declared reused.

### REUSED_ARTIFACT
__Required:__ Yes  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ This link identifies the [EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent.md) that is reused for the composition identified by __COMPOSITION__; in other words, the artifact that is not rebuilt for a that composition.

### CAUSE
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ Any  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies a cause of the event occurring. SHOULD not be used in conjunction with __CONTEXT__: individual events providing __CAUSE__ within a larger context gives rise to ambiguity. It is instead recommended to let the root event of the context declare __CAUSE__.  

### CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md),
[EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the activity or test suite of which this event constitutes a part.

### FLOW_CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the flow context of the event: which is the continuous integration and delivery flow in which this occurred â€“ e.g. which product, project, track or version this is applicable to.
