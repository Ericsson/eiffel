# EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent (ArtC)
The EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent declares that a software artifact has been created, what its coordinates are, what it contains and how it was created.

## Data Members
### data.identity
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [purl specification](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The identity of the created artifact, in [purl format](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec).

### data.fileInformation
__Type:__ Object[]  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ A list of the artifact file contents. This information is optional, and when included, MAY include a complete or incomplete list of contents. In other words, it may be used to highlight only particular files of interest, such as launcher binaries or other entry-points.

#### data.fileInformation.name
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The name (including relative path from the root of the artifact) on syntax appropriate for the artifact packaging type.

#### data.fileInformation.tags
__Type:__ String[]  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ Any tags associated with the file, to support navigation and identification of items of interest.

### data.buildCommand
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The command used to build the artifact within the identified environment. Used for reproducability purposes.

### data.requiresImplementation
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Legal values:__ NONE, ANY, EXACTLY_ONE, AT_LEAST_ONE  
__Description:__ Defines whether this artifact requires an implementing artifact. This is typically used for interfaces requiring some backend implementation, although the interface does not presume to define _which_ implementation. Implicitly interpreted as "ANY" if undefined.  
NONE signifies that there SHALL no implementations of this artifact. In other words, a composition containing another artifact identifying it in __data.implements__ would be illegal.  
ANY signifies that there may or may not be implementations of this artifact.  
EXACTLY_ONE signifies that a legal composition must contain one and only one implementation of this artifact.  
AT_LEAST_ONE signifies that a legal composition must contain one or more implementations of this artifact.

### data.implements
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [purl specification](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An array of [purl identified](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) entities this artifact implements. The typical use case of this is to identify interfaces implemented by this artifact. Note that [version range notation](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/core/MAVEN/maven_version.htm#MAVEN402) may be used for the version component of the package identity.

### data.dependsOn
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [purl specification](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An array of [purl identified](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) entities this artifact depends on. Note that [version range notation](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/core/MAVEN/maven_version.htm#MAVEN402) may be used for the version component of the package identity.

### data.name
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ Any (colloquial) name of the artifact. Unlike __data.gav__, this is not intended as an unambiguous identifier of the artifact, but as a descriptive and human readable name.

## Links
### COMPOSITION
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the composition from which this artifact was built.

### ENVIRONMENT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelEnvironmentDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelEnvironmentDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the environment in which this artifact was built.

### PREVIOUS_VERSION
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies a latest previous version (there may be more than one in case of merges) of the artifact the event represents.

### CAUSE
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ Any  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies a cause of the event occurring. SHOULD not be used in conjunction with __CONTEXT__: individual events providing __CAUSE__ within a larger context gives rise to ambiguity. It is instead recommended to let the root event of the context declare __CAUSE__.  

### CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md),
[EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the activity or test suite of which this event constitutes a part.

### FLOW_CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies the flow context of the event: which is the continuous integration and delivery flow in which this occurred â€“ e.g. which product, project, track or version this is applicable to.

## Meta Members
### meta.id
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [UUID](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122)  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The unique identity of the event, generated at event creation.

### meta.type
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ An event type name  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The type of event. This field is required by the recipient of the event, as each event type has a specific meaning and a specific set of members in the __data__ and __links__ objects.

### meta.version
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The version of the event type. This field is required by the recipient of the event to interpret the contents. Please see [Versioning](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/versioning.md) for more information.

### meta.time
__Type:__ Integer  
__Format:__ UNIX Epoch time, in milliseconds.  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The event creation timestamp.

### meta.tags
__Type:__ String[]  
__Format:__ Free text  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ Any tags or keywords associated with the events, for searchability purposes.

### meta.source
__Type:__ Object  
__Format:__  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ A description of the source of the event. This object is primarily for traceability purposes, and while optional, some form of identification of the source is __HIGHLY RECOMMENDED__. It offers multiple methods of identifying the source of the event, techniques which may be select from based on the technology domain and needs in any particular use case.

#### meta.source.domainId
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ Free text  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the domain that produced an event. A domain is an infrastructure topological concept, which may or may not corresponds to an organization or product structures. A good example would be Java packages notation, ex. com.mycompany.product.component or mycompany.site.division. Also, keep in mind that all names are more or less prone to change. Particularly, it is recommended to avoid organizational names or site names, as organizations tend to be volatile and development is easily relocated. Relatively speaking, product and component names tend to be more stable and are therefore encouraged, while code names may be an option. You need to decide what is the most sensible option in your case.

#### meta.source.host
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ Hostname  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The hostname of the event sender.

#### meta.source.name
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ Free text  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The name of the event sender.

#### meta.source.serializer
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [purl specification](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The identity of the serializer software used to construct the event, in [purl format](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec).

#### meta.source.uri
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ URI  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The URI of, related to or describing the event sender.

### meta.security
__Type:__ Object  
__Format:__  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An optional object for enclosing security related information, particularly supporting data integrity. See [Security](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/security.md) for further information.

#### meta.security.sdm
__Type:__ Object  
__Format:__  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An optional object for properties supporting the [Strong Distribution Model](http://www.cryptnet.net/fdp/crypto/strong_distro.html). Note that this only addressed the _integrity_ of the Eiffel event, not its _confidentiality_ or _availability_.

##### meta.security.sdm.authorIdentity
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The identity of the author of the event. This property is intended to enable the recipient to look up the appropriate public key for decrypting the digest and thereby verifying author identity and data integrity. The format of the author identity varies depending on the key infrastructure solution used. Note that this requires the presence of a Trusted Authority (TA) which the recipient can query for the correct public key. The identity and location of the TA must never be included in the event itself, as this would compromise the security of the solution.

##### meta.security.sdm.encryptedDigest
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The encrypted digest. The cryptographic hash function and the decryption algorithm to use, similarly to the Trusted Authority (TA), must be known to the recipient. Note that the digest of the entire event is affected by the value of this property. For this reason the input to the hash function SHALL be the entire event unaltered in all parts except for this property, which SHALL be replaced by an empty string.
