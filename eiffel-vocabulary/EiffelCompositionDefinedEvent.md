# EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent (CD)
The EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent declares a composition of items (artifacts, sources and other compositions) has been defined, typically with the purpose of enabling further downstream artifacts to be generated.

## Data Members
### data.name
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The name of the composition.

### data.version
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The version of the composition, if any. This is in a sense redundant, as relationships between compositions can be tracked via the __PREVIOUS_VERSION__ link type, but can be used for improved clarity and semantics.

## Links
### ELEMENT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent.md),
[EiffelSourceChangeSubmittedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelSourceChangeSubmittedEvent.md),
[EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies an element and/or sub-composition of this composition. The latter is particularly useful for documenting large and potentially decentralized compositions, and may be used to reduce the need to repeat large compositions in which only small parts are subject to frequent change.

### PREVIOUS_VERSION
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies a latest previous version (there may be more than one in case of merges) of the composition.

### CAUSE
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ Any  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies a cause of the event occurring. SHOULD not be used in conjunction with __CONTEXT__: individual events providing __CAUSE__ within a larger context gives rise to ambiguity. It is instead recommended to let the root event of the context declare __CAUSE__.  

### CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md),
[EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the activity or test suite of which this event constitutes a part.

### FLOW_CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the flow context of the event: which is the continuous integration and delivery flow in which this occurred â€“ e.g. which product, project, track or version this is applicable to.
