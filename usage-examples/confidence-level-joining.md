# Confidence Level Joining Example
This example illustrates how [EiffelConfidenceLevelModifiedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelConfidenceLevelModifiedEvent.md) can be used to capture and summarize a larger body of lower level results, such as test suite verdicts, effectively _joining_ multiple flows in the continuous integration and delivery system.

A JSON array of all events used in this example can be found [here](https://github.com/Ericsson/eiffel-examples/blob/master/flows/confidence-level-join/events.json).
