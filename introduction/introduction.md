# Introduction

This page provides an introduction to Eiffel: what is it, why is it and who is it for?

## Why Eiffel?

## What is Eiffel?
Eiffel is a framework for continuous integration and delivery, particularly addressing the challenges of a distributed and heterogeneous environment at an enterprise scale. It does this through the _in situ_ real time generation of globally broadcast events - events which reference one another, forming a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) describing all the activities of the continuous integration and delivery pipeline, regardless of where they took place, which underlying technology they used, or even whether they were automated or not. 

Eiffel fundamentally consists of two parts. First, a vocabulary and syntax of events, forming the communication protocol of the framework. Second, services built on top of that communication protocol to orchestrate continuous integration and delivery activities, provide traceability, dashboards, visualizations and much more.

## Who Developed Eiffel?
Eiffel was originally conceived and developed by Ericsson, where it has successfully been used to realize enterprise-wide continuous integration and delivery solutions ever since. The framework was published under the [Apache License 2.0](../LICENSE) in 2016.

## Who Should Use Eiffel?
Eiffel is technology and domain agnostic - it may be applied equally well to the continuous integration and delivery of any type of software product. That being said, it was designed with scalability and traceability of large scale systems integration in mind, and it is at scale that Eiffel brings the greatest benefits.
